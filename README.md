- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane and I'm a grad student currently doing an Master's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I've done everything from
- professional football to academic philosophy, so programmning and statistics is just a continuation of the exploration phase of the k-armed bandit
- problem that is my life.
-  I'm mainly interested in statistics, applying Machine Learning to things I'm curious about, and the philosophical implications of AI.
-  The only language I'm moderately capable in is Python, with some basic knowledge of Java and HTML.
